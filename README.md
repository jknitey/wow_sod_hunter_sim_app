This is a World of Warcraft SOD hunter damage simulator app. The goal of this app is to allow users to simulate their damage per second (DPS) based on their characters gear stats. They can play with the numbers based on different gear stats to evaluate the change to their DPS.

The app is built and deployed using Streamlit.
